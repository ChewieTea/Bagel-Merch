# Bagel-Merch
Funny website project
For Bagel
Their merch store is very cool for sure.

Honestly this is just a good chance for me to build my first website and really understand the differences between html, css and js. Not to  mention how they work together.
I want to achieve a semi-professional website whilst messing around and customising it for myself to learn more.
Next steps will be to create a dummy phishing website for a friendly, group competition and a portfolio website for me to show off my skills and projects.

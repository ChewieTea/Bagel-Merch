# BagelTV: Merchandise Website (Frontend).
  > [!important]
  > This was the first coding project I did, basing the website on an 8 hour long YouTube tutorial.

*I created the website based on the concept of a streamer's merchandise website; __BagelTV__, even adding my own photoshopped images to make it look more professional.*
*This project taught me a lot about HTML, CSS and touched upon some basic JS and PHP. Using these I was able to grow my next projects.*
